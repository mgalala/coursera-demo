Don’t call me babe \n
Cuz I’m not your darlin’\n
And I never will be \n
All your sweet nothings\n
Mean nothing to me \n
So don’t call me darlin’\n
It ain’t that easy \n
\n
You saw something you wanted\n
Made a strategy \n
But your eyes wander all over\n
It’s no mystery \n
But baby older don’t mean wiser\n
And your smile don’t make you’re kind,\n
Oh your disguise don’t mean you’re hiding a thing, oh\n
\n
Don’t call me darlin, I won’t be coming around tonight\n
I know your kindness comes with second intentions \n
Some cannot see through you&#8212; let me do you a solid \n
And point you the other way \n
Baby, don’t call me darlin today\n
\n
You think you’ll hit your target\n
If you keep on firing \n
So sure that I’m gonna soften up\n
To you over time \n
\n
But baby stronger don’t mean smarter\n
When you push you push me farther, \n
All that flattery won’t get you to me, oh</string>
