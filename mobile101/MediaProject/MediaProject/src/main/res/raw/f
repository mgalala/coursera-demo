Don’t call me darlin’
Don’t call me babe
Cuz I’m not your darlin’
And I never will be
All your sweet nothings
Mean nothing to me
So don’t call me darlin’
It ain’t that easy

You saw something you wanted
Made a strategy
But your eyes wander all over
It’s no mystery
But baby older don’t mean wiser
And your smile don’t make you’re kind,
Oh your disguise don’t mean you’re hiding a thing, oh

Don’t call me darlin, I won’t be coming around tonight
I know your kindness comes with second intentions
Some cannot see through you&#8212; let me do you a solid
And point you the other way
Baby, don’t call me darlin today

You think you’ll hit your target
If you keep on firing
So sure that I’m gonna soften up
To you over time

But baby stronger don’t mean smarter
When you push you push me farther,
All that flattery won’t get you to me, oh
